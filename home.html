                        A COVID‑19 vaccine is a vaccine intended to provide acquired immunity against severe acute
                        respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2), the virus causing coronavirus disease 2019
                        (COVID‑19). Prior to the COVID‑19 pandemic, work to develop a vaccine against coronavirus
                        diseases like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome
                        (MERS) established knowledge about the structure and function of coronaviruses; this knowledge
                        enabled accelerated development of various vaccine technologies during early 2020. On January
                        10, 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequence data was shared through GISAID, and by March 19, the
                        global pharmaceutical industry announced a major commitment to address COVID-19.

                        As of February 2021, 66 vaccine candidates are in clinical research, including 17 in Phase I
                        trials, 23 in Phase I–II trials, 6 in Phase II trials, and 20 in Phase III trials.Trials for
                        four other candidates were terminated.In Phase III trials, several COVID‑19 vaccines demonstrate
                        efficacy as high as 95% in preventing symptomatic COVID‑19 infections. As of February 2021,
                        eleven vaccines are authorized by at least one national regulatory authority for public use: two
                        RNA vaccines (the Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine and the Moderna vaccine), four conventional
                        inactivated vaccines (BBIBP-CorV, Covaxin, CoronaVac and CoviVac), four viral vector vaccines
                        (Sputnik V, the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine, Convidicea, and the Johnson & Johnson vaccine), and
                        one peptide vaccine (EpiVacCorona).

                        Many countries have implemented phased distribution plans that prioritize those at highest risk
                        of complications, such as the elderly, and those at high risk of exposure and transmission, such
                        as healthcare workers.As of 23 February 2021, 216.17 million doses of COVID‑19 vaccine have been
                        administered worldwide based on official reports from national health agencies. Pfizer, Moderna,
                        and AstraZeneca predicted a manufacturing capacity of 5.3 billion doses in 2021, which could be
                        used to vaccinate about 3 billion people (as the vaccines require two doses for a protective
                        effect against COVID‑19). By December 2020, more than 10 billion vaccine doses had been
                        preordered by countries, with about half of the doses purchased by high-income countries
                        comprising 14% of the world's population.
