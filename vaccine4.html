Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine, codenamed mRNA-1273, is a COVID-19 vaccine developed by the United States National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), and Moderna. It is administered by two 0.5 mL doses given by intramuscular injection given four weeks apart.

It is an RNA vaccine composed of nucleoside-modified mRNA (modRNA) encoding a spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, which is encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles. It is one of the two RNA vaccines developed and deployed in 2020 against COVID-19, the other being the Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine.

On 18 December 2020, mRNA-1273 was issued an Emergency Use Authorization by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It was authorized for use in Canada on 23 December 2020, in the European Union on 6 January 2021, and in the United Kingdom on 8 January 2021.

In January 2020, Moderna announced development of an RNA vaccine, named mRNA-1273, to induce immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Moderna's technology uses a nucleoside-modified messenger RNA (modRNA) compound which is named mRNA-1273. Once it is inside a human cell, the mRNA links up with the cell's endoplasmic reticulum. The mRNA-1273 is encoded to tell the cell to make a specific protein using the cell's normal manufacturing process. Once it is expelled from the cell, it is eventually detected by the immune system, which begins generating efficacious antibodies. Upon the announcement Moderna's shares rose dramatically, and the chief executive officer (CEO) and other corporate executives began large program sales of their shareholdings. The drug delivery system of mRNA-1273 uses a PEGylated lipid nanoparticle drug delivery (LNP) system.
